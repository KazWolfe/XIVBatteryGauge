# ðŸ”‹ BatteryGauge

Hey, you! Yes, you! Do you play FFXIV on your laptop? Or your Steam Deck? Doesn't it
just *suck* when your battery dies? This is just the plugin for you!

Battery Gauge is a very simple plugin: all it does is add a new entry to your Server
Info Bar that contains your device's current battery percentage and (if not plugged
in), how much longer your battery will last. 

This plugin is a demo plugin, and is therefore in maintenance-only mode. It is very
unlikely that BatteryGauge will receive new features or UI polish, although bugs 
will be fixed. If you want to contribute new features, however, I won't turn them 
down!
