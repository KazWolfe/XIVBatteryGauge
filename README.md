# ðŸ”‹ BatteryGauge

Hey, you! Yes, you! Do you play FFXIV on your laptop? Or your Steam Deck? Doesn't it
just *suck* when your battery dies? This is just the plugin for you!

Battery Gauge is a very simple plugin: all it does is add a new entry to your Server
Info Bar that contains your device's current battery percentage and (if not plugged
in), how much longer your battery will last. 

This plugin will eventually have some config options to allow you to customize how
your battery information will look, but for now everyone gets the same experience.

## Installing the Plugin

Wait for it to hit Dalamud testing, please :)
